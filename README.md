# Doublet (in Go)

A CLI word game where you transform one word into another by changing one letter at a time.
Each intermediate step must also be a valid dictionary word.

## Rules

- Start and target must be the same length.
- Each move must change exactly one letter.
- Every move must produce a valid word.
- You must stay within the allowed max changes.

## Run

```bash
go run ./cmd/cli
```

You can provide flags instead of prompts:

```bash
go run ./cmd/cli -start cat -end dog -difficulty hard -solve
```

## Web API

Start the HTTP server (run from the project root so dictionary files resolve):

```bash
go run ./cmd/web
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8080` to play in the browser.

Game state is kept in memory with bounds to limit resource use:

- `-max-games` (default `2000`) — evicts the least recently used game when full
- `-game-ttl` (default `24h`) — removes inactive games after this duration; access refreshes the timer

A background cleanup runs every 5 minutes to drop expired games.

`POST /api/games` is protected against CPU exhaustion:

- `-create-rate-limit` / `-create-rate-window` (default `20` per `1m` per IP) — rejects excess create requests with HTTP 429
- `-max-concurrent-bfs` (default `4`) — caps simultaneous path searches; excess waits up to `-bfs-wait` (default `5s`) then returns HTTP 503
- `-path-cache-size` (default `4096`) — caches shortest paths for repeated start/end pairs

JSON API bodies are capped at `-max-request-body` bytes (default `8192`); larger requests get HTTP 413.

The UI supports suggested doublets, custom start/target words, difficulty selection, move history, and win/lose feedback.

API endpoints:

- `POST /api/games` — start a game (`start`, `end`, `difficulty`, optional `max`)
- `GET /api/games/{id}` — fetch game state
- `POST /api/games/{id}/move` — submit a move (`word`)
- `GET /api/suggestions` — random easy/medium/hard doublet pairs

## Deploy to Fly.io

Requires a [Fly.io](https://fly.io) account and the [Fly CLI](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/).

```bash
fly auth login
fly launch    # first time only; pick a unique app name if doublet is taken
fly deploy
fly open
```

The Docker image builds `cmd/web` and copies `web/`, `words.txt`, and `words-large.txt` into the container.

## Dictionary Options

Use a built-in preset:

- `-lexicon small` uses `words.txt`.
- `-lexicon large` uses `words-large.txt` (default).

Use your own dictionary file:

```bash
go run ./cmd/cli -dict mywords.txt -start cold -end warm -difficulty medium -solve
```

When `-dict` is provided, it overrides `-lexicon`.

## Difficulty Options

- `easy`: max changes = shortest path + scaled slack (`+1` for 1-step, `+2` for 2–4 steps, `+3` for 5+)
- `medium`: max changes = shortest path + scaled slack (`+0` for 1-step, `+1` for 2–4 steps, `+2` for 5+)
- `hard`: max changes = shortest path (no slack)
- `custom`: requires `-max`; must be at least the shortest path length and at most `shortest + 10` (capped at 100). Preset difficulties ignore any `max` sent in the API.

Examples:

```bash
go run ./cmd/cli -lexicon small -start cat -end dog -difficulty easy -solve
go run ./cmd/cli -lexicon small -start cat -end dog -difficulty custom -max 3 -solve
```

## Interactive Commands

During gameplay:

- `/hint` shows the next step on the shortest path.
- `/solve` reveals the full shortest path.
- `/quit` exits the game.
